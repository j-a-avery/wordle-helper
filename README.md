# Wordle Helper

A simple project to practice some things (JavaScript at first, TypeScript later; prefix trees/tries; Angular) and to help me solve Wordle puzzles.

The goal is to have a full web UI (and maybe even host it as a web app, if I can finish beford Wordle's fifteen minutes of fame is up).

For now it has a basic, primitive, barely-functional REPL because

1.  I wanted to be able to use it immediately, but
2.  A more urgent/important project came up.
